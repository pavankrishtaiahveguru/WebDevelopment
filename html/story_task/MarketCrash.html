    <h2 style="background-color: lightblue;">&#128201; Stock Market Crash &mdash; Scam 1992</h2>
    <p><b>Scam 1992</b> is based on the real events surrounding <b>India’s biggest stock market crash</b>, triggered by a massive financial fraud committed by stockbroker <b>Harshad Mehta</b> in the early 1990s.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/images/market_crash.jpeg" alt=" graph" style="width: 400px;">
    <p>Harshad Mehta, a middle-class man with big dreams, discovered loopholes in India’s banking system. He illegally obtained huge sums of money from banks using <b>fake Bank Receipts (BR<sup>s</sup> )</b> &mdash; documents meant for secure inter-bank transactions. Instead of using the funds for legitimate purposes, he pumped the money into the stock market to manipulate share prices and create artificial demand.</p>
    <p>As stock prices soared, investors flooded the market, and Harshad gained fame as the <q>Big Bull</q> of Dalal Street. The market boom appeared unstoppable &mdash; until it all came crashing down.</p>
    <p>In April 1992, journalist <b>Sucheta Dalal</b> exposed the scam, revealing that Harshad had misused over ₹5,000 crores. This led to a sudden and sharp <b>stock market crash</b>:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Share prices plummeted</li>
        <li>Thousands of investors lost their life savings</li>
        <li>Several banks and institutions faced huge losses</li>
        <li>Several banks and institutions faced huge losses</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The aftermath of the crash led to:</h4>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Strengthening of <b>SEBI</b> (Securities and Exchange Board of India)</li>
        <li>Reforms in <b>banking regulations</b></li>
        <li>Introduction of <b>electronic trading systems</b> for better transparency</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Scam 1992</b> is not just a story of one man’s fraud — it’s a turning point in India’s economic history that highlighted the urgent need for <b>reform, regulation, and honesty</b> in the financial world.</p>
