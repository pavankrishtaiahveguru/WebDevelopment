    <h1 style="background-color: lightcyan;"> &#128214; <u>Scam 1992 – The Harshad Mehta</u></h1>
    <p >The <b>Harshad Mehta</b> Story is a thrilling financial crime drama that tells the <u>real story</u> of <b>Harshad Mehta</b>, a stockbroker who <i>propelled</i> the Indian stock market to <mark>record-breaking levels</mark> &mdash; and then <b>destroyed</b> it. A financial sector during the early <b>1990s</b>. The series follows his rise from an ordinary man to the most dominant force on <b>Dalal Street</b> &mdash; and how it all came tumbling down.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color: lightcyan;">&#127793; Humble Beginnings</h2>
    <p><b>Harshad Mehta</b> was born to a middle-class Gujarati family and began with zero. After performing odd jobs, he found himself at the <q> Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)</q> as a <i>jobber</i> &mdash; a person who facilitated the buying and selling of shares for brokers. Intrigued by the dynamics of the market, Harshad started studying it intensively and learned how to take advantage of inefficiencies.</p>

        During the late 1980s, Harshad established his own company, <b>GrowMore Consultancy.</b> Leveraging his market knowledge, he started purchasing undervalued stocks and selling them later after artificially creating a bubble around their prices. His arrogance and flashy lifestyle &mdash; replete with luxury automobiles and a sea-facing flat &mdash; attracted the attention of the media, and before long, he became the <i><q style="color: red;">Amitabh Bachchan of the Stock Market</q></i> or <i><q style="color: red;">The Big Bull.</q></i>

    <h2 style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;">&#128184; The Scam Unfolds</h2>
    <p>But in the background, Harshad was taking advantage of huge loopholes in India's banking system. He employed bogus <b>Bank Receipts (BRs)</b> &mdash; documents that are meant to reflect secured transactions between banks &mdash; to borrow money illegally and invest in the share market.</p>
    <p>He channeled huge amounts ( <b>more than ₹5,000 crorese</b> ) of money from banks into the market without valid collateral. Shares jumped artificially, and Harshad's wealth boomed. He went so far as to say that what he was doing was not illegal but rather using <q style="color: red;">the system creatively.</q></p>

    <h2 style="background-color: beige;">&#9878;&#65039; The Journalist Who Exposed It All</h2>
    <p>All this changed when financial journalist Sucheta Dalal at The Times of India started looking into Harshad's abnormally large financial transactions. Her <b>April 23, 1992</b>, article disclosed the scam, causing a huge downfall of the stock market.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color: lightgrey;">&#9878;&#65039;Downfall and Legal Battles</h2>
    <p>When the truth came out, Harshad Mehta was arrested. Several banks and financial institutions were entangled. The fraud resulted in the loss of public faith in the stock market and banking system. Several cases were registered against Harshad and his friends.</p>
    <p>Harshad spent years going to and from prison, waging battles in the courts. Although he asserted that others were equally guilty and that he was being scapegoated, his credibility was tarnished.</p>
